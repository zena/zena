= yamltest

* http://github.com/zena/yamltest/tree

== DESCRIPTION:

yamltest lets you configure unit test with yaml documents. Simply define a "yt_parse" method
that will transform your "src" (source) into a "res" (result).

== FEATURES:

* Ease of context definition.
* Multiple step testing with different keys.
* Tests are only created if a test with the same name does not exist.
* Named tests (easy to get information on failed tests).
* If someone asks, I can try to fix my TextMate Bundle that runs the tests (all or one at a time) 
  from the yaml file and put it online.

== SYNOPSIS:

  class TestSomething < Test::Unit::TestCase
    yamltest :directory => 'relative/path/to/yaml/files'
    
    def yt_parse(key, source, context)
      do_something_with(source, context)
    end
    
    yt_make
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* yaml, test/unit

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install yamltest
