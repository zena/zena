  This is the default skin for zena. You should be *very careful* if you change this skin: it is used to display/edit itself.

  When creating your own skins, you should *always avoid* to display your skins with themselves. This is tempting but will put you in trouble if you need to edit a broken template.

  By the way, have a look at the designer documentation for "zafu":http://zenadmin.org/en/documentation/page44.html for ideas on how to create a new skin with very few lines of zafu (using clever include tricks).
